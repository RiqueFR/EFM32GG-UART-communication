## Using all EFM32GG knowledge to create a communication UART program

This code uses all previous EFM32GG knowledge and code to create a communication using UART.
You can send command to turn LED1 on or off and send PWM value to control LED0 brightness.
You will receive a frase saying if PB0 and PB1 are pressed and the ADC value for a potentiometer.
As always, all external libraries are from hans-jorg, and you can check his GitHub for more information.
